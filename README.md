#J2OBJC plugin

This is a clean reboot of the now deprecated [j2objc-gradle project](https://github.com/google/j2objc)

Due to my allergy for groovy and love for xtend + gradle, I decided
to write a smaller gradle plugin for j2objc.

## Get started

You need gradle to build this gradle plugin project.

Go to the directory, enter command line instructions:
```
gradle wrapper # for the first time, not necessary when the wrapper has been created
./gradlew build
```
